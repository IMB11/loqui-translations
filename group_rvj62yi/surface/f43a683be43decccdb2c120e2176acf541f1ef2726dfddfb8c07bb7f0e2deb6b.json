  "tome.surface.page.hollowed_log.desc": "Why are they hollowed? Did something eat their insides? Quite possibly. Hollowed logs can be found all across the world in different forest biomes. Once broken, they'll drop sticks, and, if you get lucky during rain, a tiny snail can crawl from the log you've broken with a 10% chance.",
  "tome.surface.page.carved_planks.desc": "You wanted vertical planks? Well, those are even better! And also are pretty cheap to craft.",
